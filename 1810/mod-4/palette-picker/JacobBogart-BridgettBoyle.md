 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/jacobogart/Palette-Picker-BE/blob/master/README.md)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- We are proud of our BE documentation. It looks very professional and it clear and easy to use. We often used it when developing the front end to ensure we were using the correct naming conventions.

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/B-Coyle/Palette-Picker-FE/blob/master/test/index-test.js)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- This is our discarded vanilla/jQuery test file. We got all the functionality working with only jQuery, but ran into issues with testing and deployment and decided to switch to React.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 * Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it  

- See FE README

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- Very clear and simple, with easy input output testing. Using the database itself to get the mockData added even more simplicity.
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- Frustrating to debug at first, but very conveneint to have everything happen automatically.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- Only minor issues with making sure you were in the correct directory in the terminal, but the compartmentalization was overall an asset.
